# TSBB15-Project1-Group4

## About
This tracking system's goal is to track moving objects in a sequence of images. It is made of 5 main blocks, each with its own responsibility:

- Data reading
- Background modeling
- Foreground segmentation
- Tracking 
- Evaluation

Communication occurs solely from top to bottom.

## How to run
Run `pip install tsbb15_labs` to install the necessary dependencies (numpy, pillow, scipy, matplotlib & opencv-python).

While inside the folder `/own`, run `python main.py`.
